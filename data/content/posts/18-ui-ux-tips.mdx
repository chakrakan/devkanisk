## Typography Tips

- Use no more than 2-3 typefaces in a page as additional typefaces increases cognitive load.
- Use 125%-150% line height for paragraph text to make your webpage feel more spacious!
- Keeping lines of text under 100 characters chunks text and makes it more readable.
- Use typefaces that look noticeably different for header and paragraph text. Some pairings I really like are: Libre Baskerville & Source Sans Pro, Domine & Roboto, and DM Serif Display and Proxima Nova.
- When creating text hierarchy try to use no more than two mechanisms to differentiate text: (1) font weight, (2) font size, (3) alignment/indentation, and (4) color.
- Skip weights and double point sizes between different text elements used. For example, if your header text is 32px bold, then make the paragraph text 16px regular â€” rather than something like 24px semibold for the header text.

## Alignment/Spacing Tips

- Avoid centering text unless it's a small chunk.
- Align left to right if targeting english-speaking folks as people read left to right.
- Aligning things to each other can make design look clean and consistent! Using a 12 column grid can be a helpful place to start!
- Use negative space to help differentiate elements from each other.
- A general rule of thumb: in most cases, you'll want at least 12-16px of padding between different elements or from the edge/corners of the page.

## Color

- Use neutral tones to allow your primary colors to shine. Neutral tones (whites, greys, and blacks) can balance out bright colors and give them emphasis.
- Use tints and shades to add dynamism to your project. Have a hover state or pressed state? Use tints and shade to indicate these changes.
