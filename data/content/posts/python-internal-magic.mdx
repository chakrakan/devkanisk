You can change the value of an integer in memory due to how the Python compiler optimizes int storage.

`int` in python is an object, and for values from -5 to 255 they always refer to the same object in memory for performance. This reference is created in the heap, whereas, in languages like C, the individual `int` would occupy a portion in the stack.

This is where we can leverage the `ctypes` module to create something like this:

```python
import ctypes

def swap(int_obj: int, value: int) -> None:
    ctypes.cast(id(int_obj), ctypes.POINTER(ctypes.c_int))[6] = value
```

This function can change the reference for underlying value within the python int object.

So, if we do something like:

```python
age = 18
swap(18, 0)
print(age)
```

the initial `18` should be "swapped" and we should end up with `age = 0`.
