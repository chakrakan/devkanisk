Python for loops are quite useful and nifty...

Something like this is great and easy to use:

```python
for i in range(10):
  add_business(name=fake.company())
```

However, understanding iteration is the key to mastering any programming language.

Let's replace this with a corresponding while loop:

```python
it = iter(range(10))
while True:
  x = next(it)
  add_business(name=fake.company())
```

At a glance, it seems like we've created an infinite loop - however, the design decision chosen
by Python creators involve having the `next()` call raise an exception, in order to specify that
the iteration is done.

Running the above code as is would add businesses as expected but would end in a `StopIteration` exception.
With Python, you get an exception within every single for-loop which is hidden away from the user.

In order to truly configure this as a for loop is designed, we'd have to re-write the code as following:

```python
it = iter(range(10))
while True:
  try:
    x = next(it)
  except StopIteration:
    break
  else:
    add_business(name=fake.company())
```

So remember, every single time you use a for-loop like the one we began with in this post, the above is what is
happening undercover üïµÔ∏è
