### Network Optimizations

Improve network performance:

- shrink file size - more KBs to download the more it takes time. Minimize files, optimize images, reduce data size.
  - HTML, CSS, JS can be minimized easily → minify with uglyfyjs or using webpack
  - Images
    - JPG: no transparency background, big in file size
    - PNG: limit colors and smaller in size than JPG, add transparency to bg
    - GIF: limit total colour counts used on a gif
    - SVG: vector graphics, small size, high rez

- the travelling delivery man
  - Use CDNs like [https://imgix.com/](https://imgix.com/)
    - pay them, upload images there, they provide you links you can use in your app for images which are optimized and provided via a cdn based on location
  - remove image exif data [https://www.verexif.com/en/](https://www.verexif.com/en/)
    - for performance + security reasons
  - use media queries to serve content to the respective screen size [https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/media-queries-for-standard-devices/)

- delivery method and optimizations
  - optimize for less trips
  - the HTML protocol will only allow set max num file downloads from one domain at a time ranging from 2-6 depending on browser
  - combine css files into 1, js files into 1, etc.

### Critical Render Path Intro

  />
</p>

- In the critical render path, there are 8 steps, the very first step is the download of the HTML file
- the browser starts creating **the DOM**, and incrementally generates the tree model of the html tags within the file
- DOM describes the contents of the page
- just when it starts to do that, it gets the style link, so it fetches the CSS file
- this starts the simultaneous creation of **the CSSOM** (CSS Object Model) which has the styling information attached to the tree nodes, in a similar fashion to the DOM
- then, slowly it traverses down the html file and sees the script tag with a link to a js file, so it grabs that
- the JS file is read by the browser and executes any changes requested within the DOM and the CSSOM
- once that is done, the browser combines the DOM and the CSSOM into a **render tree** which has information of both, the html, and the styling
- it uses the render tree to create the layout based on the files and paint the layout and pixels onto the screen
- thus, we finally have our web-page
  - btw, any images and other types of files needed are also fetched in the background and are not part of this process

### Improving Step 1 of CRP: Streaming of the HTML file to the browser

- start loading CSS as early as possible
- load JS as late as possible (few exceptions like google tag to track what a user is doing as early as site load). Normally if you put it earlier than script tags at the bottom, it will block the render and other resources being downloaded
- JS requires HTML and CSS parsing to be done before it can begin its work (step 4)

### Improving Step 2 of CRP: Streaming of the CSS file to the browser

- CSS is render blocking (can’t create render tree before we have the CSS to create CSSOM)
- make CSS as lightweight as possible
- only load whatever is needed
- above the fold loading
  - only load what’s on the main page
    <p align="center">
      <Image
        className="rounded-md"
        alt="Above the fold loading"
        src="/static/post-images/web-performance/3.png"
        width={600}
        height={450}
        placeholder="blur"
        blurDataURL="/static/post-images/web-performance/3.png"
      />
    </p>
- media attributes
  - can use it to load stylesheets too
  - link tags have a hidden `media` attribute which defaults to all
  - we can change it to `media="only screen and (min-width:500px)"` for a particular stylesheet to be
- less specificity
  - good:
    ```css
    a.important {
      color: pink;
    }
    ```
  - bad:
    ```css
    .header .nav .item .link a.important {
      color: pink;
    }
    ```

### Improving Step 3 of CRP: Streaming of the JS file to the browser

- load scripts async’ly
  <p align="center">
    <Image
      alt="Script-tag-async-defer-comparison"
      src="/static/post-images/web-performance/4.png"
      width={600}
      height={600}
      placeholder="blur"
      blurDataURL="/static/post-images/web-performance/4.png"
    />
  </p>
- `<script async>`
- go ahead dl the js file with another thread
- non blocking
- when it’s done dl’ing, it immediately executes js which might be bad for us:
  - if it executes long after the page load, then if we are relying on the JS for changes to UX, we’ll provide bad UX to user
  - if executes before page load, we can’t do any DOM manipulation resulting in error
- good for scripts that don’t manipulate the DOM - like tracking or analytics
- `<script defer>`
- wait to execute AFTER our html is parsed
- good for scripts that will act on the DOM
- minimize DOM manipulations all together
  - this will block from the CRP to moving to the next step → creating the render tree
  - if you have one or more js files in script tags, sync tags will block other js files to be loaded if there are DOM manipulations ongoing in the first script
- avoid long running javascript!
  - avoid alerts and random blocking JS code

### Improving Step 4 of CRP: Steps 4-8

- Render tree enables the layout and position then paints the elements
- Step 8 is if JS events change any part of the page, the browser revisits the render tree, redraws and re paints again
- modern browsers are smart enough for partial re-draws, but try to limit
