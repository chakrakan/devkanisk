### What is NextJS

A framework built on top of React, gives you the flexibility of building scalable apps by allowing you to **render content on the server** in advanced.

It's a full-stack framework because it provides us a node server out of the box

With **CreateReactApp** - you render content on the line, there's no server side processing

With **NextJs** - you can mix things up for a singular project, do static site generation (SSG) for certain pages, or do server side rendering (SSR) for others, or client-side rendering (Incremental-Site-Regeneration) as well!

#### Different Rendering Techniques

**Static Site Generation** - All content gets [[nextjs-pre-rendering|pre-built]] on the server, cached, and then served to the client. Well suited for static content such as a products page, blog posts, stores, etc. since the cached content is fetched over and over from the server providing great performance

`getStaticProps()` - HTML generated at build time (predownloaded)

**Server Side Rendering** - If data changes dynamically on refresh of the page, then we use server side rendering. Well suited for a dynamic news feed, reddit style forums (w/ upvotes etc.), netflix

`getServersideProps()` - HTML generated for every request

**Incremental Site Generation** - best of both SSG + SSR aka we get to generate the static page in advance on the server, and any dynamic content can be fetched or re-fetched after and updated.

`getStaticProps() with revalidate` - HTML generated at specific interval

#### Performance

- Automatic Code-splitting
- Minifying files
- Image optimization (based on viewport, serves optimized images)
- Prefetching assets (only load stuff above the fold and prefetch content the user is most likely to visit or scroll downt to)

#### Convenience

Create React App needs React Router or something similar to help with routing
Nextjs has default file base routing system

Specific `api` folder to hold backend logic or server-side code within there

#### SEO

Easier for bots to crawl the page, rank the page, and helps your page appear in places across the web
`<Head>` component to create [[next-seo|SEO]] friendly content

Bot aware ISR `fallback: true` condition to help SEO, where bots aren't crawling the loading state, but actual fallback content provided during loading/fetching of data to render page.

#### Serverless Functions

Anything within the `api` folder is backend - so we can route to it just like we would for any other api.
This helps with:

- credential management (no storing on client)
- cold start -> process -> shutdown (save cost)
