            I&apos;ve been writing and taking notes of random subject-matter
            ranging from technical bits to abstract thoughts using various tools
            and services since early 2020.
          </p>
          <p>
            The following are a smattering of those thoughts cobbled together
            into an <em>informal</em>, yet readable format for anyone who dared
            to venture into this corner of the internet.
          </p>
          <p>Happy reading! ðŸ“–</p>
